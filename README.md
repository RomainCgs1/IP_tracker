# IP_tracker
This is a small application that allows you to "translate" Alcasar's immutabilities_logs. Open a pdf file, the application will analyze it and display the website corresponding to the IP. You can save this report.

You can run the Launcher or simply double-click on the jar file (located in the "out" directory).
Then just open your file (generated by Alcasar) and IP_tracker will try to find the website corrisponding to IPs.
Next you can read the repport or save it.

/!\ if the window "Error : a jni error has occurred please check your installation" appears, try to update your Java version. To do so, download the latest java version here : https://www.java.com/fr/download/manual.jsp, delete the java file in the Applications directory and open the file you just dowloaded.
